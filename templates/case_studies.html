                    <p>
                        Mitchell & Associates was growing through paid advertising but struggling with referral growth. 
                        Managing Partner Sarah Mitchell knew they had satisfied clients but couldn't pinpoint why 
                        referrals had plateaued. Online reviews were positive (4.2 average) but lukewarm compared 
                        to competitors.

                    <h3>The Approach</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mitchell uploaded 187 historical reviews spanning 3 years. Law Firm Insights analysis revealed 
                        a pattern: <strong>23% of reviews mentioned billing confusion</strong>, even among 4- and 5-star 
                        ratings. Comments like "great outcome but the billing was confusing" and "wish costs had been 
                        clearer upfront" appeared repeatedly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The firm used the 90-day implementation plan to:

                    <p>
                        Within 90 days, fee-related complaints dropped from 23% to 4% of reviews. Average rating 
                        climbed to 4.8. Most importantly, referral rate jumped 40% in Q2.

                    <p>
                        Park Legal Group was losing clients to competitors despite having strong legal expertise. 
                        Exit interviews were rare, and the partners couldn't agree on whether the issue was pricing, 
                        service quality, or something else. Operations Director David Park suspected communication 
                        gaps but had no data to back it up.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote class="case-quote">
                        "In partner meetings, everyone had a theory. Marketing blamed pricing. Senior partners 
                        blamed junior associates. Nobody had numbers to settle the debate."

                    <h3>The Approach</h3>
                    <p>
                        Park uploaded feedback from intake surveys, Google Reviews, and follow-up questionnaires—264 
                        reviews total. Law Firm Insights identified <strong>responsiveness as the #1 complaint theme</strong>, 
                        mentioned in 41% of neutral/negative reviews. Clients used phrases like "took days to hear back," 
                        "felt left in the dark," and "had to chase them for updates."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Armed with this data, the firm implemented:

                        <li><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Created client-facing SLA promising 24-hour response to non-urgent inquiries</li>
                        <li><strong>Month 2:</strong> Launched automated weekly case status emails</li>
                        <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> Integrated response-time tracking into associate performance reviews</li>

                        significantly—fewer clients "went dark" mid-engagement. With stronger retention, the firm 
                        reduced ad spend by $12K/year while maintaining revenue.

                        Torres Family Law had a 3.7 average rating on Google—not terrible, but not competitive 
                        in a market where most firms hovered around 4.5+. Partner Jennifer Torres knew client

                        After analyzing 92 reviews, Law Firm Insights revealed that <strong>compassion/empathy was 
                        the lowest-scoring theme</strong> despite good marks on legal expertise. Clients described
